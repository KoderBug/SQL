# SQL
The SQL queries in SQLQueryDrill1-6 were based on an animal feeding database.  These queries were simple to learn some basic commands.  The queries became progressively more involved creating, updating and joining tables as well as learning stored procdures.

For the Library Project I created my own data to populate the tables of a Library Management system.  The data created had several requirements that had to be fulfilled so that specific queries could be written against the table and executed as stored procedures.
