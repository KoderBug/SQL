# SQL
The SQL queries in SQLQueryDrill1-6 were based on an animal feeding database.  These were simple queries to learn basic SQL commands.  The queries became progressively more involved: creating, updating and joining tables as well as learning stored procdures.

For the Library Project I created my own data to populate the tables of a Library Management system.  The data created had several requirements that had to be fulfilled so that specific queries could be written against the table and executed as stored procedures.
